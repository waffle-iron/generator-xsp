## Requirements

Node v4 LTS, v5, or v6 stable is required. This *should* work with iojs v3, but is known to fail on node v0.12 and v0.10 ([refs issue #3](https://github.com/edm00se/generator-xsp/issues/3)). If, for some reason, you *need* to make this work on older versions of node, as of [v0.2.0](https://github.com/edm00se/generator-xsp/releases/tag/v0.2.0) you should be able to fork this repo and remove the use of [update-notifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/update-notifier). It claims to work w/ node >= v0.10, but my experience shows otherwise. But hey, if you're using something older than v4 LTS, what are you up to anyway?

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-xsp using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-xsp
```

## Use

Then generate your new project:

```bash
mkdir my-new-proj
cd my-new-proj
yo xsp
```

### Importing to DDE

Importing your On Disk Project (ODP) into IBM Domino Designer is the end-goal. This will not work as a full NSF application without being interacted with from a Domino Designer instance.

If you need help getting started with source control and its relationship to Domino/XPages applicaitons, you may wish to get started at [Notes in 9 episode 131: Use SourceTree for Better XPages Source Control](http://www.notesin9.com/2013/11/12/notesin9-131-use-sourcetree-for-better-xpages-source-control/).

### Sub-Generators

A sub-generator is one that creates/scaffolds a _part_ or _parts_ of an _app_. By default, yeoman will generator the entirety of the defined _app_. For example, if one were to [look at generator-angular](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular#generators), you would find that you can scaffold an _app_ or a specific _directive_ or _filter_, etc. The format of this follows the basics of `yo xsp:<sub-generator>`.

Available are:

* XPages, `yo xsp:xpage`
* Custom Controls, `yo xsp:cc`
* more coming soon!

### Optional Inline Naming

For any of the sub-generators, you can optionally pass in as a CLI parameter the name, as opposed to being prompted for it each time. An example of creating an XPage in your app (from the rood project directory path), with a name of "beer" (`ODP/XPages/beer.xsp`), is:

```bash
yo xsp:xpage beer
```

## About

Yeoman is a "scaffolding tool for modern webapps". This generator, a scaffolding "blueprints", invoked after Yeoman's CLI command (`yo anAwesomeGenerator`), was built using [Yeoman's generator-generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-generator). Feel free to [learn more about it at all yeoman.io](http://yeoman.io/).

The generator builds a starter On Disk Project (ODP) from which this application (NSF) can be built. The NSF is a stock app, with virtually no content, save this XPage, for reference.

Out of the box, you should be prompted for an applicaiton name (which will drive the ap name, ODP name, and file name). Over time, more options will be configured to prompt, with defaults specified.

### An XPages Flavor

To see more about how this, and other advanced, node-based tooling, can be used with XPages applications, check out the author's [blog series on task runners with Domino/XPages](https://edm00se.io/task-runners-with-domino-apps).
