# Road Map

Currently planned

Near term:

- [x] default app Theme inclusion
- [ ] starter CSS and JS files
- [ ] possibly automate pulling from XPages boilerplate resources, such as a `JSFUtil` class, etc.

Long term:

- [ ] config of **common** XSP properties
- [ ] config inclusion of `ExtLib` (assumes dependency already on server), and/or other/given plugins to enable for NSF
- [ ] specify the Theme the app theme will extend (Bootstrap 3, oneui, webstandard, etc.)
- [ ] scaffold basic Java packages and classes
- [ ] scaffold managed bean (at specified *Scope)
